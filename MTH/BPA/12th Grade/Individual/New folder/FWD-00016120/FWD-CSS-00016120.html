    <p>Social media can be an amazing thing. We all use it every day in great ways: connecting with people, access to information, fun and enjoyment, shopping, etc. However social media has its cons: information overload, peer pressure and cyber bullying, privacy issues. Everything you type, post, and share will never truly delete. Even when you think it will. As a student, you might not worry about everything you post and share, but one day you will. You will need to worry about how your social media makes you appear for when you are applying for a job, starting a business, or building a brand.</p>
